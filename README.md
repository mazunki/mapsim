# mapsim

A map simulator. Uses p5js, and allows the user to store simple tile-based maps. 

Will eventually support RPG-stuff.

## Running
- To run, simply clone with `git clone github.com:mazunki/mapsim.git`, and then run with ./webserver.sh`. 
- Open your browser, and load `localhost:8000`.

## Troubleshooting
- If you don't have permissions to run the `.sh` file, try `[sudo] chmod +x webserver.sh`, or run directly with Python's HTTP server.
